    %hr

    %p This website is dedicated to helping (future) Neutrinet members to acquire parts of, or complete, <a href="http://labriqueinter.net">[fr] Internet Cube</a>.

    %p Please bear in mind that we do not sell hardware components, we buy it for you so that the overall process is eased and you benefit from lower rates.

    %h3 About the process:
    %ol
      %li through this website, you will get to chose your desired components (and optionally subscribe to the Neutrinet VPN service) ;
      %li the website will provide you with an estimated price and even though you are not required to pay now, by ordering, you commit yourself to pay the estimated price (it may vary slightly) ;
      %li as soon as we have enough orders, we will make a group order, let you know about the definitive price and the estimated time of arrival ;
      %li once the components arrive, except if you explicitly asked otherwise, we will configure and install everything for you ;
      %li finally, we will let you know when you can come and grab your Cube (and/or components) and, except if you have opted out, finish the configuration with you and explain to use it.

    %p Neutrinet is as strong as his community is, join us!
