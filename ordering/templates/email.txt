Hello {{ order.first_name }} {{ order.last_name }},

We're happy to confirm your order for one or more cubes!

Here are your choices:

{% if not order.wants_to_install_everything_himself %}* You've asked us to configure everything for you{% else %}* You have chosen to install everything by yourself{% endif %}
{% if order.wants_vpn %}* You've decided to subscribe to our VPN service{% else %}* You have chosen NOT to subscribe to our VPN offer{% endif %}
{% if order.domain_name %}* You've asked us to order your domain name "{{ order.domain_name }}" for you and {% if not order.wants_neutrinet_to_renew_the_domain %}NOT {% endif %}to handle its renewal
{% endif %}
{% if order.wants_vpn %}Here are your personal information you've provided for the VPN:

* Street: {{ order.street|default:"" }}
* Postal code: {{ order.postal_code|default:"" }}
* Town: {{ order.town|default:"" }}
* Birth place: {{ order.birthplace|default:"" }}
* Country: {{ order.get_country_display|default:"" }}
* Birth Date: {{ order.birth_date|default:"" }}

Please, make sure that these are correct, we need them in order to comply
with the Belgian law.
{% endif %}
{% if order.comment %}And you have left us this comment:

{{ order.comment }}{% endif %}

And, most importantly, you have ordered:

{% for co in order.componentorder_set.all %}* {{ co.number }} x {{ co.component }} for {{ co.number }} x {{ co.component.current_price }}
{% endfor %}
For an *estimated* total of {{ order.estimated_price }} â‚¬.

We will contact you once your order has arrived and inform you about when we
can meet to finish the installation together and explain you how it works (it
is very likely that this will be at our next meeting, once every two weeks).

Your order might take some time, we generally wait to have a certain number of
orders, so we can group them to reduce price and to split the shipment costs.
As soon we have received your material we will notify you and provide payment info.
The actual software provisioning might take some extra time. Should you want to try
and install it all yourself, do contact us and we will try and get your equipment to
you as soon as possible. 

If you are in a hurry, you might want to place the order by yourself.

If you have any questions, want to modify your order or cancel it, just drop
us an email at cube@neutrinet.be

Have a nice day,

<3
