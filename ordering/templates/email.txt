Hello {{ order.first_name }} {{ order.last_name }},

This email is a summary of the order you've made for a cube (or more).

Here are your choices:

{% if not order.wants_to_install_everything_himself %}* you've ask us to configure everything for you{% else %}* you have chosen to install everything by yourself{% endif %}
{% if order.wants_vpn %}* you've decided to subscribe to our VPN offer{% else %}* you have chosen NOT to subscribe to our VPN offer{% endif %}
{% if order.domain_name %}* you've ask us to take the domain name "{{ order.domain_name }}" for you and {% if not order.wants_neutrinet_to_renew_the_domain %}NOT {% endif %}to handle its renewal
{% endif %}
{% if order.wants_vpn %}Here are the information you've provided for the VPN:

* Street: {{ street }}
* Postal code: {{ postal_code }}
* Town: {{ town }}
* Birth place: {{ birthplace }}
* Country: {{ country }}
* Birth Date: {{ birth_date }}

Please, make sure that those informations are correct, we need them to comply
with the law.
{% endif %}

And, most importantly, you have ordered:

{% for co in order.componentorder_set.all %}* {{ co.number }} x {{ co.component }} for {{ co.number }} x {{ co.component.current_price }}
{% endfor %}
For an *estimated* total of {{ order.estimated_price }} â‚¬.

We will contact you once your order has arrived and inform you about when we
can meet to finish the installation together and explain you how it works (it
is very likely that this will be at our next meeting).

Don't expect it to be immediate, we generally wait to have a certain number of
order because we get reduced price if we order more material and to split the
shipment cost. Also when we have the time to do that, we are doing this on our
free time.

If you are really in a hurry, you might want to do the ordering by yourself.

If you have any questions, wants to modify your answer or cancel it, just drop
us an email at cube@neutrinet.be

Have a nice day,

<3
