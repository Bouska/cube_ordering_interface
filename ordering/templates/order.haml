        %h3 Subscription to Neutrinet VPN (recommended)

        %p
          %i If you already have a VPN subscription you don't need to fill this section.

        %p
          One of the big advantages of the Internet Cube is that it can connect to a VPN giving it a public ip address (it's like having a public phone number). It solves <b>a LOT</b> of problems and allows the Internet Cube to works in a <i>plug'n play</i> fashion. We <b>really</b> recommended you to take one, if you don't, we expect you to know what you are doing.

        %p
          By taking a VPN subscription you'll become a member of the Neutrinet ASBL/VZW. It is important to note we have members, not subscribers, we are an association, not a commercial <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>.

        %p
          You pay what you want for the VPN subscription, with a minimum of 8€/month. This includes your ASBL/VZW membership fee of 25€/year (split as 2€/month, you even win 1€!). If you have already paid your membership, the min price is 6€/month.

        %p
          %b You need one VPN subscription per cube for which you want a public IP.

            The Belgium Telecom laws (and ASBL/VZW for the address part) requires us to ask you theses informations. Please fill out the form above correctly.

        %h3 Domain name (optional)

        %p
          Your cube will be associated to a domain name, by default, YUNOHOST allows you to have a free domain name that ends with <i>.nohost.me</i>. If you want another domain name, we can take care of buying it for you. If you already have a domain name or prefer a <i>.nohost.me</i>, you don't need to complete this field.

        %p
          The price will be split across your VPN subscription (for example, for a domain at 12€/year, this will add 1€/month to your VPN subscription). We are using <a href="https://gandi.net">Gandi</a> so check here to see how much it will cost (<b>V.A.T. is not included in the prices displayed by Gandi, it's 21%</b>).

        %p
          %b Make sure that the domain name you've chosen is available.

        %p
          %i Also please take into account that we don't own nor have any relation to Gandi, so we can't be held accountable for their service (though they are very reliable).

          The prices listed here are the prices we will get if we order at least 10 units, we also add 5€ as an estimation of the split shipment cost.

        %p
          We have a special deal with Olimex that allows for a lower price. Our prices <b>include VAT</b> unlike those on Olimex website.

        %p
          <b>The final price may vary from what is shown here, it's only an estimation</b>, but, hopefully, this should closely approximate the actual price.
